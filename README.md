# Developing-Data-Products
Developingg Data Products would cover how projects can be delivered as final products which have real life applications. It is divided into three(3) parts which are highlighted below: 
## Interactive Webpage Map
This is a map visualization that does not only show locstion of places but it also has interactive feature which can serve the user with required information.

## Interactive Visualization
This is a data visualization feature that allows the user to play around to with the data, collecting different types of information without making use of multiple visualization. It also allows for multiple dimensions to be featured in the visualization. This project can be viewed at https://rpubs.com/Deletella01/708308

## Shiny Application
This is a shiny application project makes use of Motor Trend Data, a magazine containing Data about the automobile industry looking at a data set of a collection of cars, We are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). Under this analysis, we can answer the question: Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG,by quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions, among other analysis that can be conducted. It contains a Boxplot of Fitted Model, a line indicating the model on a plot of MPG vs an input Variable, it also shows the Summary of the Model. The app is divided into two parts: User Interface(UI) and Server which serves as the engine of the application.

Shiny App for this project can be found at https://deletella.shinyapps.io/MPG_Shiny_App/?_ga=2.206488917.770227211.1630272933-2052850049.1630272933
