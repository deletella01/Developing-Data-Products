# Developing-Data-Products

This is a shiny application project for the Courseraâ€™s Developing Data Products. We make use of Motor Trend Data, a magazine containing Data about the automobile industry looking at a data set of a collection of cars, We are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). Under this analysis, we can answer the question: Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG,by quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions, among other analysis that can be conducted. It contains a Boxplot of Fitted Model, a line indicating the model on a plot of MPG vs an input Variable, it also shows the Summary of the Model. The app is divided into two parts: User Interface(UI) and Server which serves as the engine of the application.

Shiny App for this project can be found at https://deletella.shinyapps.io/MPG_Shiny_App/?_ga=2.206488917.770227211.1630272933-2052850049.1630272933
